                <p>DeSantis's gubernatorial platform included support for legislation that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly.[48] He also supported a law mandating the use of E-Verify by businesses and a state-level ban on sanctuary city protections for undocumented immigrants.[48] DeSantis promised to stop the spread of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee.[48] He expressed support for a state constitutional amendment to require a supermajority vote for any tax increases.[49] DeSantis opposed allowing able-bodied, childless adults to receive Medicaid.[49] He said he would implement a medical cannabis program, but he opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis.</p>
                <p>DeSantis has sharply criticized the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, in which veteran deaths were linked to wait times. He co-sponsored the VA Accountability Act, which aims to increase accountability by providing for the removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs based on performance or misconduct.[282][283] He is a member of the Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus.</p>
